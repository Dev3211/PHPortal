# PHPortal
PHPortal is a simple MYSQL shell used for executing queries. It can also be used for viewing your database, tables, etc. For extra security, when you start the shell it will ask for your MYSQL details. Whether the query fails or not, PHPortal will surely notify you about it. PHPortal is meant to be used from the console as it's not really a web shell.
